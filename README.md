# Infinity Scroll with Unsplash API
Project Description:
The Infinity Scroll with Unsplash API is a web application that allows users to scroll through random images from Unsplash as they keep scrolling down the page. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes the Unsplash API to fetch the images. The application is also fully responsive, allowing users to access it from any device.

Features:

Infinity Scrolling: The application allows users to keep scrolling down the page to see new images without having to click any buttons.
Unsplash API Integration: The application integrates with the Unsplash API to fetch random images to display to the user.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
Lazy Loading: The images on the page will load as the user scrolls, improving the performance of the application.
Technologies used:

HTML: Used to structure the web page.
CSS: Used for styling the web page.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the infinity scrolling and API integration.
Unsplash API: Used to fetch random images for display on the page.
Functionality:

When the user lands on the page, they will see the first set of images loaded from the API.
As the user keeps scrolling down, more images will be fetched from the API and displayed on the page.
The images are displayed in a grid format with a consistent aspect ratio for a visually appealing display.
The images are lazy-loaded, meaning they will only load as the user scrolls, improving the performance of the application.
Challenges:

One of the major challenges in this project is implementing the infinity scrolling feature using JavaScript to fetch more images from the API as the user scrolls down the page.
Another challenge is ensuring that the images are displayed in a visually appealing manner on the page while maintaining a consistent aspect ratio.
Potential Improvements:

Adding search functionality to allow users to search for specific types of images from Unsplash.
Adding a feature that allows users to save their favorite images to view later.
Implementing a feature that allows users to share images on social media platforms.
Overall, this Infinity Scroll with Unsplash API project is an exciting and challenging project that will allow users to discover and enjoy new images as they scroll down the page. The use of Unsplash API ensures that the images displayed are of high quality and diverse, while the responsive design ensures that the application can be accessed from any device.
